This project was built with [Tortilla](https://tortilla.academy).

### Run instructions

Make sure to clone the server first

    $ git clone https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-Client-Angular.git

Run yarn

    $ yarn install

Optionally run codegen to re-generate the TypeScript types

    $ yarn generator

Note that the types are generated from the server! So the server must be running and you must provide username and password (try with `ethan` and `111`).

Start the server, see run [instructions](https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-server).

Run start

    $ yarn start

Note that the server should run on port `4000`.
